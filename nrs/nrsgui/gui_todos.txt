TOP PRIORITY
----------------------------------------------------------------------

* Too much work being done on the main event-dispatching thread (a.k.a.
the Swing Thread). This is causing several bugs, e.g. the black-box bug where
node boxes are painted black, and either remain black or repaint correctly when
mouse cursor is moved over it.

* Implement the Discovery Process. This process will allow the GUI to discover
an existing NRS network, including nodes and links, and their states.

* Stop Attribute editor throwing exceptions when an entry is blank. Should do
checking when OK is clicked.

* Show status information. Split status bar to display status information about
performed operations, e.g. display 'Saved' when user saves a network. Improve
UI design.

* Automatic generation of CSL from source code. This would be ideal, for
severalreasons. The main one being to improve consistency between the
CSL and the actual code. It would also greatly reduce the hassle for new users.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
MEDIUM PRIORITY
----------------------------------------------------------------------

* For fast linking method, we will need to see the name of the variable
  belonging to an interface as the mouse hovers over. Add this tool tip
  support (doubt I can use JToolTip).

* Response of variables to being clicked - eg, prep the popup menu for
  variable actions. This is the general category of variable
  manipulation.

* The <NumberInfo/> minVal and MaxVal attributes aren't being used in
  the Attributes dialog - any number is okay, even though two of the
  attributes are conductance and capacitance which are
  non-negative. This is the general category of attribute validation.

* There should also be a right click option on the network browser to
edit the item selected (ie to return to the attributes dialog). Ie., add
a properties editor, which may or maynot be the same thing as the
initial attributes editor dialog displayed when a node is first created.

* As I said before, it would be nice to have a text printout in the
types browser for the nodes.

* The repainting in the NetworkBrowser is very inefficient. Currently
  clip regions are not being used, which means repaint requests result
  in a larger that necessary area being repainted.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
LOW PRIORITY
----------------------------------------------------------------------

* When a ReplyCType is used to load a CSL, the GUI should compare the
  version numbers in the ReplyCType and the stored CSL - if they
  don't match, then a warning should be generated.

* Toolbox windows are always appearing ontop of the node browser

* Network navigator window (JTree view on the network)

* Zoomed out view of the current network level - for an example, view
  the JGraph examples on the JGraph home page, or also try running
  JGraphPad. Basically the zoomed out view is a separate toolbox window
  which shows the complete network in minature, together with a
  rectangle indicating where the currently selected Network browser is
  positioned at.

* It would also be nice in the Attributes dialog to have a description
of the type you are clicked on, and the information on where that gets
used.

* The javadoc usage by the makefile is not including java files in
  subdirectories two levels or more below nrs/

* BUG-FIX: Object layering not working for variables. Cannot do a
  send-to-back on a collection of variable that have not had their
  layers previously adjusted.

* BUG-AVOID: Make a check for variables within a Node that share either
  the same Name or DisplayName, since the latter especially if often
  used for JMenuItem text and event detection in the callback. For that
  to work, the variables must all be unique.
