This contains the code specific to the <i>NRS.gui</i> application,
including the code for operating the GUI elements of the application,
and the classes and other structures required for representing a user
specified neural network.

This package relies on the {@link nrs.core.comms} and {@link
nrs.core.base} packages for many of the utility classes for manipulating
messages, FIFOs, ports, etc.
