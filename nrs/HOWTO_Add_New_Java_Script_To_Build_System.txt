HOWTO add a new autogenerated Java script to the build system
------------------------------------------------------------

(1) Add a sequence of commands to the makefile nrs/Makefile.am.

(2) The easiest way to do this is to copy an existing section (such as
    NRS.gui) and modify it until it meets your needs. In the process
    you should choose a name for the new script (such as NRS.myComponent).

(3) Modify the configure.ac file in the base NRS directiory:

    - search for the export JAVA_SCRIPTS command (there may be several, for
      different platforms - you will likely want to make the same
      changes to each).

    - in the list of files assigned to the JAVA_SCRIPTS variable, add in
      the name of your new script (eg NRS.myApp).

    - append any new directories that are required by the sources to AC_OUTPUT.

(4) Modify the EXTRA_PROGRAMS variable in nrs/Makefile.am - append the
    name of the new script (eg NRS.myComponent).

(5) Now perform an autoreconf and rebuild the sources.  The new script
    should appear.
