greatly appreciate 3 things:

- Let us know if you use the code

- Let us know about any bugs, and return any bug-fixes and
  improvements you may make to us (at some point we intend to put the
  code on a public site to make this simpler)

- If you undertake research using this code and write a paper, we
  would appreciate being acknowledged - the NRS software developers in

INSTALLATION
------------

The first time you extract the code from CVS you need to run:

aclocal
libtoolize
autoheader
automake --add-missing
autoreconf

This only needs to be done after you first check out the CVS code. For
other times when the makefiles need to be updated, just use autoreconf.
If you are using a source snapshot not from CVS this first step should
not be necessary.

Then choose an installation directory and add <installdir>/bin to your
PATH enviroment variable, e.g. in your .bashrc add:

export PATH=$PATH:<installdir>/bin

To build the code you must:

-- create an object directory and enter it:

mkdir <objdir>
cd <objdir>

... if you've changed the Makefile.am file anywhere:

cd <srcdir>
autoreconf

... if you haven't run configure before:

cd <objdir>
<srcdir>/configure --prefix=<installdir> --disable-static

-- anyway:

cd <objdir>
make install

N.B. after building the documentation is available as:
<installdir>/share/nrs-2.0-alpha/doc/NRS.pdf

-- to run the code:

NRS.gui
NRS.component
NRS.nsim to run the component with the nsim plugin loaded, or
NRS.component nsim

-- or to get csl output from a component:

NRS.nsim --csl
NRS.component --csl nsim
NRS.component --csl libnsim.so

Compiling the Camera Tracking
=============================

By default the camera tracker component is not built when NRS is
built. To enable it, use the option --enable-camera when executing the
configure command.

Currently the camera tracker requires two external libraries be present
in order to compile successfully. These are ccvt and OpenCV. Versions
which have successfully worked previously are:

 * ccvt-0.3.tar.gz 
 * OpenCV-0.9.5.tar.gz

These should be available on the Internet somewhere, but also from the
site from which NRS was obtained.

To successfully build NRS with the camera tracking component, you will
need to do:

1. Obtain and install the above source code packages for ccvt and OpenCV

2. Compile these two libraries, and install locally

3. Update your OPENCV_LIBDIR, OPENCV_INCDIR, CCVT_LIBDIR and
   CCVT_INCDIR environment variables to reflect the installation paths
   you chose for each library if they are non-standard and configure
   the NRS sources, as indicated above, but including the
   --enable-camera option.

   Example (which works on Edinburgh DICE computers):

  > OPENCV_INCDIR=/disk/cricketlab/include
  > OPENCV_LIBDIR=/disk/cricketlab/lib
  > CCVT_INCDIR=/disk/cricketlab/include 
  > CCVT_LIBDIR=/disk/cricketlab/lib

  > configure --prefix=/home/richardr/install --enable-camera

Note that on the robotlab DICE machines all these files are installed
in /disk/cricketlab

4. Continue building NRS as normal, i.e., make, make install, etc.
