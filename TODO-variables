Variables which are not selfUpdating and which have exactly one input
which has the same type and stateHolding characteristics as that input
should be merged with that input. This will massively reduce the
number of variables in the system, as (for instance) there will only
be one MessageSender and Updater and Timestep and SimTime, which are
currently spread throughout most nodes. Variables will then have multiple
names and vnids.

Issues:

- Any query now has to be associated with a variable name or vnid, and
  variables cannot have their names or vnids queried directly;

- Inside variables, all connections have to be associated with a name or
  vnid;

- Methods have to exist to detect merger and demerger candidates when
  connections are made and broken;

- Methods have to be made to merge and demerge Variables and inform
  observers, internal link targets and sources, and nodes of variable
  changes.
